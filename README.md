# Social Network Analytics for Anti-Money Laundering â€“ A Systematic Literature Review and Experimental Evaluation

The source code of the experimental evaluation of the paper *Social Network Analytics for Anti-Money Laundering -- A Systematic Literature Review and Experimental Evaluation*.

It provides an implementation of different network learning techniques in a uniform manner.

## Data
The main experiment is done on the elliptic dataset. Additional code is present that was used to verify the correct working of the code on the Cora dataset. 

This repository does not provide any data, due to size constraints. The data can be found online using the following links:
- [Cora](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.Planetoid.html#torch_geometric.datasets.Planetoid)
- [Elliptic](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.datasets.EllipticBitcoinDataset.html#torch_geometric.datasets.EllipticBitcoinDataset)
